# text-morphing-effect
A text animation effect where text breaks apart into a 3D sphere of characters, representing AI "thinking" before reassembling with highlighted insights.


## Features

- Text morphs into animated 3D character sphere
- Smooth multi-phase animation (chaos → sphere → return)
- Highlights key phrases after "analysis"
- Mobile-responsive design
- Pure vanilla JavaScript - no dependencies

## How It Works

1. **Character Extraction**: Each character's exact position is measured
2. **Chaos Phase**: Text breaks apart with random jitter
3. **Sphere Formation**: Characters form a rotating 3D sphere
4. **Analysis**: Sphere rotates while "thinking"
5. **Return**: Characters reassemble with highlighted insights

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Click "Analyse" to start the effect.

## Customization

You can customize:
- Highlighted phrases (line 580)
- Animation durations (line 290)
- Sphere size and rotation speed
- Visual styling
